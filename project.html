    <h2>Our Heritage</h2>

    <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where
    Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our
    customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the
    early coffee traders.
    
    Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated with
    Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to
    another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned
    to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown
    aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.
    
    Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New York.
    By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over
    the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens
    of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: to
    inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.</p>
